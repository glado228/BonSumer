These instructions will lead you through the setup of a development instance. This instance can be used for develpment and testing.

Requirements (you need to install this software for the development instance to work):

- PHP composer
- Node.js
- NPM (node package manager)
- MySQL or SQLite
- MongoDB


How you do it:

1) "cd" into the folder of the file you are currently reading (the git repository main folder).

2) run composer to install all PHP dependencies:

php <PATH_TO_YOUR_COMPOSER_SCRIPT> install

PLEASE NOTE: composer sometimes rate limits anonymous users when downloading a large number of files.
Therefore, during the installation process you might be prompted for a GitHub account. Just enter your
GitHub credentials to continue the installation. Any account will do.


3) run NPM to install all the Node.js stuff:

npm update


4) Install gulp (if not already installed):

npm install --global gulp

5) Create an emtpy manifest.json file:


echo '{}' > resources/manifest.json


6) Run gulp to compile CSS, Javascript and other resoruces

gulp


7) If you want to use SQLite instead of MySQL, change the database settings to use sqlite. To do so, open "config/database.php" and
replace the line containing:

 'default' => 'mysql',

 with:

  'default' => 'sqlite',

And, if you are using MySQL, you will need to specify the credentials:

DB_HOST=				the host where the database is running, most likely "localhost"
DB_DATABASE=			the name of the database
DB_USERNAME=			the username
DB_PASSWORD=			the password


8) Run the following command to create an empty configuration file:

cp .env.example .env

9) Install monbgodb and the mongodb PHP driver if they are not already installed.

 a) Install the database. How to do it depends on your platform, take a look here: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/ for plarform-specific instructions.

 b) Install the PHP driver: http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/php/

 c) Update the environment variables in .env with the MongoDB credentials:

MONGO_HOST=				the host where the database is running, most likely "localhost"
MONGO_DATABASE=			the name of the database
MONGO_USERNAME=			the username
MONGO_PASSWORD=			the password

10) Fill the databases with the tables we need:

php artisan migrate

NOTE: if you are using SQLite and it complains about the storage/database.sqlite file not being readable or not containing a valid database, try to replace storage/database.sqlite with an empty file.

11) Fill the newly-created tables with test data:

php artisan db:seed

This will create 2 testing user accounts: test@test.com (with admin rights) and noadmin@test.com (ordinary user with no admin rights). The password for both accounts is 'test'.

12) Almost done! Now start the development server:

php artisan serve

The application should now be reachable from the browser at http://localhost:8000/


NOTE: There is a test account you can use if you need to log in:

With admin rights:
Username: test@test.com
Password: test

Ordinary user without admin rights:
Username: noadmin@test.com
Password: test


ONLY FOR ADMIN MODE:

13) To enable CKEDITOR media embded plugin (we use the plugin to edit content in admin mode), you will have to download the plugin's zip archive from here:

http://ckeditor.com/addon/oembed

and unzip its content into vendor/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins
