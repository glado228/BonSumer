<strong>Our website has made a conscious decision to forgo the use of Google Analytics and use a European alternative, Piwik.</strong>&nbsp;This web analysis service uses so-called &quot;cookies&quot;: text files that are saved on your computer and are used by us to analyse visitors&#39; use of our website. As such, cookie-generated usage information (including a truncated version of your IP address) is passed to our server and stored for analysis purposes. Information gained through this analysis helps us optimise the website for our users. Your IP address is anonymised at the beginning of this process, which means that you as a user remain anonymous. Information generated by cookies about your use of this website will not be passed to third parties. You can block the use of cookies by making the appropriate changes to the settings on your browser software; however, please note that if you choose to do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website and we will not be able to credit Bonets to you. If you do not wish data from your visit to be stored and analysed, you can prevent this from happening at any time with a click of your mouse. In this case, a so-called &quot;opt-out cookie&quot; will be deposited in your browser and will stop Piwik collecting any data from your session. <strong>Please note</strong>: if you delete cookies, the opt-out cookie will be deleted as well and must be re-activated by you if you wish to continue using its effects. At this point, you can decide whether a unique web analytics cookie may be deposited in your browser to enable the website operator to to record and analyse different statistical data for the purposes of website optimisation.<br />

Your IP address will be passed with every server request so that the server knows where the answer must be sent. Every internet user gets an IP address from their internet service provider (ISP) as soon as they are connected to the internet and the ISP can determine which IP address was assigned to which of its customers at which point in time. So long as an IP address is saved, the identity of the port owner may theoretically be determined indirectly via the ISP. For this reason, we and our web statistics provider store the IP address in a truncated (anonymised) form and use it only to identify the session and to protect ourselves from attacks. The IP address is then deleted immediately, which means that data collected remains anonymous and cannot be assigned to the identity of the user, even indirectly via the ISP.',
