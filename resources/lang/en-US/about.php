In ten years&#39; time, no-one wants an earth that&#39;s depleted of resources, or an environment that&#39;s destroyed. We want to give our children a chance to live in harmony with nature - and in order to make that possible, we have to start rethinking our attitude <em>today</em>.&nbsp;We believe that consumer habits are shifting. Sustainability is increasingly a topic of intense and controversial discussion. Consumers are paying more and more attention to what they&#39;re buying, where it comes from - and how it was produced. We&#39;re not asking people to go without; rather, we&#39;re focused on helping each and every individual to adopt a more responsible attitude to the environment they live in. With this in mind, we&#39;ve dedicated ourelves to promoting responsible, sustainable shopping habits. By simplifying access to sustainably produced consumer goods, our platform is aimed at winning people over to the idea of sustainable consumer behaviour.',
